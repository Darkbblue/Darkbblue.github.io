## Research Interests
I'm currently interested in diffusion models, or specifically, their application in discrimination. We know diffusion models are at the first place generative models, but there are ways to utilize them for discrimination, such as diffusion feature and training-free diffusion segmentors.  

My special interests are in two topics: 1. As newer diffusion models with new architectures are being devised, how can we make the discriminative utilization extensible across models? 2. Is it possible to let the discriminative usage of diffusion models in return facilitate the generative purpose?
